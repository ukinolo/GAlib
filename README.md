## More about the project
This project is conceived as my attempt to better understand genetic algorithms, and what better way to understand a topic than to try to explain it. <br>

This is the first part of my project, in which I attempt to better understand the current methods and strategies used in genetic algorithms. My goal is to implement all the most popular methods into one library that could be used to find optimum based on the fitness function. Apart from implementing, I am also documenting and writing about how each and every method is working.<br>

My idea for the second part of the project is to experiment with novel methods for genetic algorithms and to see if they are effective. This couldn't be possible without knowledge I gained from this project and without baseline I am creating here.
